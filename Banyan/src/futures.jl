    Future(future::AbstractFuture)

Constructs a future from a future that was already created.

If the given future has not had its value mutated (meaning that the value
stored with it here on the client is the most up-to-date version of it), we use
its value to construct a new future from a copy of the value.

However, if the future has been mutated by some code region that has already
been recorded, we construct a new future with location `None` and mark it as
mutated. This is because presumably in the case that we _can't_ copy over the
given future, we would want to assign to it in the upcoming code region where
it's going to be used.
